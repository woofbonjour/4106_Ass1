**4. Generate and Test**

This is a basic algorithm which follows the following process:
1. Generate a possible solution candidate.
2. Test the candidate.
- If the candidate meets the criteria, then it is considered valid and the solution.
- If not, alter some part of the candidate and repeat.

The idea behind this algorithm, is that once a solution is found, it stops generating and does not seek to optimise unlike the other algorithms in this assignment.
