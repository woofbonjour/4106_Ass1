**4. Generate and Test**

The idea behind this method is that, once a solution is found, it stops generating and does not seek to optimise unlike the other algorithms in this assignment.

For this reason, we do not expect a high success rate for "best picks".

This is a basic algorithm which follows the following process:
1. Generate a possible solution candidate.
2. Test the candidate.
  - If the candidate meets the criteria, then it is considered valid and the solution.
  - If not, alter some part of the candidate and repeat.

Criteria:
- The weight of the knapsack is within its capacity.

Alteration:
- The method used in this generation, will be starting from a full sack and removing a block in a reverse binary sequence. 





**Your Analysis:**
The success of this algorithm is ~51% which means only half of the solutions are the expected "best pick". While this method garuntees a solution that satisfies our hard contraint of being within the knapsack capacity, it clearly doesn't offer a high likelyhood of obtaining an optimal solution.
