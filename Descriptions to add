**4. Generate and Test**

The idea behind this method is that, once a solution is found, it stops generating and does not seek to optimise unlike the other algorithms in this assignment.

For this reason, we do not expect a high success rate for "best picks".

Algorithm:
1. Generate a possible solution candidate.
2. Test the candidate.
  - If the candidate meets the criteria, then it is considered valid and the solution.
  - If not, alter the candidate and repeat.

Criteria:
- The weight of the knapsack is within its capacity.


Alteration:
- The generator will start by having all the blocks in the knapsack and, if the candadite surpasses the weight capacity, generate the next heaviest arrangement of blocks.\
Eventually, the arrangement will be light enough to either satisfy the weight capacity which will then be a valid solution, or will be fully empty in which case there is no solution.

**Your Analysis:**
The success of this algorithm is ~51% which means only half of the solutions are the expected "best pick". While this method guarantees a solution that satisfies our hard contraint of being within the knapsack capacity, it clearly doesn't offer a high likelyhood of obtaining an optimal solution.

Notes:
- The first method we took generated candidates completely at random. This had a 0% success rate for "best picks".
- Another route was explored with a different alteration method: starting with all blocks in the knapsack, then removing blocks at random rather than by ordered weight. This had a lower success rate of ~42%.

In comparrison, the final method used in the algorithm above of generating the next heaviest option and testing it was a more successful approach for finding the optimal solution. This method does require sorting the blocks by weight for each row in the dataset. However, because we are only dealing with 5 blocks in this scenario, this does not add much computing time.


## For Annelaing #################################
**6. Simulated Annealing**

This algorithm introduces exploration by occasionally accepting suboptimal solutions, facilitated by a cooling mechanism. This allows the algorithm to search for a global maximum rather than settling for a local one. After each iteration, the algorithm's likelihood of accepting worse solutions decreases, aiding it in converging toward an optimal solution.

Algorithm:
1. Generate a random solution candidate.
2. Alter the current candidate in some way to create its neighbour.
3. Compare the current candidate with its neighbour.
  - If the new candidate is a better solution, set it as the current candidate.
  - If not, set it as the current candidate based on the temperature probability.
4. Repeat for a number of iterations and take the best candidate found as the solution.

Criteria:
- Each candidate must be a valid solution, ie must not surpass the weight limit for the knapsack.

Alteration:
- Add or remove one block. The block will be chosen based off the best weight to price ration.

**Your Analysis:**

The accuracy of this algorithm is only around 52%. We would expect this to be able to hone in on the global maximas more often, as the cooling method allows more exploration of the full solution space.

Note: Another method we tested for generating neighbour candidates was to randomly chose whether to add or remove a block, then chose which block by random. This had a similar average of around 51%, which means alterations made off the weight-price ratio is not much of an improvement.

Overall, to allow more of the solution space to be explored, it's recommended that some changes be made to the method in how the alterations of neighbours are decided.
